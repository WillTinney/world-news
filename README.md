Ruby on Rails app that uses the 'News API' (https://newsapi.org/) to show news articles from around the world. It features an interactive JS map that brings up news articles relevent to the country clicked on.

Although this News API provides articles from over 70 sources, the country range is limited, and so in the future I would like to incorporate more news APIs or switch to one with a bigger global spread.
